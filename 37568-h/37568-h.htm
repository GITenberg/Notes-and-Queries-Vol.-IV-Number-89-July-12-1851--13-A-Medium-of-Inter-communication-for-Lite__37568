<h3><span>PRIVATELY PRINTED BOOKS AND PRIVATELY ENGRAVED PORTRAITS.</span></h3>

<p>If the "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES,"</span>  in the course of its career, had only called
the attention of antiquaries to the necessities of collecting epitaphs
and inscriptions to the dead found in churches, and thus brought into
active exertion a large number of zealous and intelligent recorders of
monuments, its usefulness would have been fully established; but the
multitude of suggestive hints and recommendations constantly appearing
in its pages, added to the great amount of precise and unquestionable
knowledge given to the public through its means, have established the
publication as of the greatest importance to archæologists, and literary
men generally.</p>

<p>A noble and highly regarded author (Lord Braybrooke) has recently shown
the necessity for recording the existence of painted historical
portraits, scattered, as we know they are, throughout residences of the
nobility and gentry, and from thence too often descending to the humble
dwelling or broker's warehouse, through the effluxion of time, the ill
appreciation, in some instances, of those who possess them, or the
urgencies of individuals: but there are other memorials of eminent
persons extant, frequently the only ones, which, falling into the
possession of but few persons, are to the seeker after biographical or
topographical knowledge, for the most part, as though they had never
existed. I allude to Privately Printed Books and Privately Engraved
Portraits. Surely these might be made available to literary persons if
their depository were generally known.</p>

<p>How comparatively easy would it be for the readers of the
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," in each county, to transmit to its pages a short note of any
privately engraved portrait, or privately printed volume, of which they
may be possessed, or of which they have a perfect knowledge. Collectors
could in most instances, if they felt inclined to open their stores,
give the required information in a complete list, and no doubt would do
so; but still a great assistance to those engaged in the toils of
biographical or other study could be afforded by the transmission to
these pages of the casual "Note," which happens to have been taken at a
moment when the book or portrait passed under the inspection of a
recorder who did not amass graphic or literary treasures.</p>

<p>As respects some counties, much less has been done by the printing press
to furnish this desideratum; at least that of privately engraved
portraits. In Warwickshire, a list of all the portraits (with a few
omissions) has within a few years been brought before the public in a
volume. In Norfolk, the <i>Illustrations of Norfolk Topography</i>, a volume
containing an enumeration of many thousand drawings and engravings,
collected by Dawson Turner, Esq., of Great Yarmouth, to illustrate
Blomefield's
<span class="pagenum">[18]</span><a id="History18"></a>
History of the county, is also a repertory of this
kind of instruction, as far as portraits are concerned. Privately
printed books are entirely unrecorded in this and most other localities.
Without the publication now mentioned, persons having no personal
knowledge of Mr. Turner's ample stores would be not only unacquainted
with that gentleman's wonderful Norfolk collection, but also ignorant
that through his liberality, and the elegant genius and labours of
several members of his family, the portfolios of many of his friends
have been enriched by the addition of portraits of many persons of great
virtues, attainments, and learning, with whom he had become acquainted.
In Suffolk, the veteran collectors, Mr. Elisha Davy, of Ufford, and Mr.
William Fitch, of Ipswich, have compiled lists of portraits belonging to
that county. These are, however, in manuscript, and therefore
comparatively useless; though, to the honour of both these gentlemen let
it be said, that no one ever asks in vain for assistance from their
collections.</p>

<p>I trust it can only be necessary to call attention to this source of
knowledge, to be supported in a view of the necessity of a record open
to all. I have taken the liberty to name the
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" as the
storehouse for gathering these scattered memorabilia together, knowing
no means of permanence superior, or more convenient, to literary
persons, although I am not without fears indeed, perhaps convictions,
that your present space would be too much burthened thereby.</p>

<p>As the volume of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" just completed has comprised a
large amount of intelligence respecting the preservation of epitaphs,
the present would, perhaps, be appropriately opened by a new subject of,
I am inclined to think, nearly equal value.</p>

<h3><span>SARDONIC SMILES.</span></h3>

<p>A few words on the <ins title="[Greek: Gelôs sardanios]">&#915;&#8051;&#955;&#969;&#962;
 &#963;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8049;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962;</ins>, or Sardonius Risus, so
celebrated in antiquity, may not be amiss, especially as the expression
"a Sardonic smile" is a common one in our language.</p>

<p>We find this epithet used by several Greek writers; it is even as old as
<i>Homer's</i> time, for we read in the <i>Odyssey</i>, <ins title="[Greek: meidêse de thymô sardanion mala toion]">&#956;&#949;&#8055;&#948;&#951;&#963;&#949;
 &#948;&#8050; &#952;&#965;&#956;&#8183;
&#963;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8049;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#8049;&#955;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</ins>,
 "but he laughed in his soul a very bitter laugh."
The word was written indifferently <ins title="[Greek: sardanios]">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8049;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962;</ins>
and <ins title="[Greek: sardonios]">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8057;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962;</ins>; and some
 lexicographers derive it from the verb <ins title="[Greek: sairô]">&#963;&#945;&#8055;&#961;&#969;</ins>,
 of <ins title="[Greek: sesêra]">&#963;&#8051;&#963;&#951;&#961;&#945;</ins>, "to show the teeth, grin like a dog:"
especially in scorn or malice. The more usual derivation is from
<ins title="[Greek: sardonion]">&#963;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8057;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</ins>, a plant of Sardinia
 (<ins title="([Greek: Sardô])">&#931;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#8061;</ins>), which was said to
distort the face of the eater. In the English of the present day, a
Sardonic laugh means a derisive, fiendish laugh, full of bitterness and
mocking; stinging with insult and rancour. Lord Byron has hit it off in
his portraiture of the Corsair, Conrad:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "There was a laughing devil in his sneer,</p>
     <p>  That rais'd emotions both of <i>rage</i> and <i>fear</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>In Izaak Walton's ever delightful <i>Complete Angler</i>, Venator, on coming
to Tottenham High Cross, repeats his promised verse: "it is a copy
printed among some of Sir Henry Wotton's, and doubtless made either by
him or by a lover of angling." Here is the first stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Quivering fears, heart-tearing cares,</p>
     <p>  Anxious sighs, untimely tears,</p>
          <p class="i5"> Fly, fly to courts,</p>
      <p class="i5">Fly to fond worldlings' sports,</p>
      <p> Where strained <i>Sardonic</i> smiles are glosing still,</p>
      <p> And Grief is forced to laugh against her will;</p>
    <p class="i5">Where mirth's but mummery,</p>
     <p class="i5">And sorrows only real be."</p>
</div>

<p>In Sir J. Hawkins's edition is the following note on the word "Sardonic"
in these lines:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Feigned, or forced smiles, from the word <i>Sardon</i>, the name of
   an herb resembling smallage, and growing in Sardinia, which,
   being eaten by men, contracts the muscles, and excites laughter
   even to death. Vide <i>Erasmi Adagia</i>, tit. R<span class="smcap lowercase">ISUS</span>."</p>

<p><i>Sardonic</i>, in this passage, means "forced, strained, unusual,
artificial;" and is not taken in the worst sense. These lines of Sir H.
Wotton's bring to mind some of Lorenzo de Medici's in a platonic poem of
his, when he contrasts the court and country. I quote Mr. Roscoe's
translation:&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
<p>"What the heart thinks, the tongue may here disclose,</p>
      <p>Nor inward grief with outward smiles is drest;</p>
      <p>Not like the world&mdash;where wisest he who knows</p>
      <p>To hide the secret closest in his breast."</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, July, 1849, in an article on Tyndale's
<i>Sardinia</i>, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The <i>Sardonic smile</i>, so celebrated in antiquity, baffles
   research much more than the <i>intemperie</i>, nor have modern
   physiologists thrown any light on the nature of the deleterious
   plant which produces it. The tradition at least seems still to
   survive in the country, and Mr. Tyndale adduces some evidence to
   show that the <i>Ranunculus sceleratus</i> was the herb to which these
   exaggerated qualities were ascribed. Some insular antiquaries
   have found a different solution of the ancient proverb. The
   ancient Sardinians, they say, like many barbarous tribes, used to
   get rid of their relations in extreme old age by throwing them
   alive into deep pits; which attention it was the fashion for the
   venerable objects of it to receive with great expressions of
   <i>delight</i>: whence the saying of a Sardinian laugh (vulgo),
   laughing on the wrong side of ones mouth. It seems not
   impossible, that the phenomenon may have been a result of the
   effects of 'Intemperie' working on weak constitutions, and in
   circumstances favourable to physical depression&mdash;like the
   epidemic chorea, and similar complaints, of which such strange
   accounts are read in medical books."</p>

<h3><span>PRIVATE AMOURS OF OLIVER CROMWELL.</span></h3>

<p>I know nothing more of the enclosed, than that I found it with the MS.
which I lately sent you on the subject of Cromwell's "Dealings with the
Devil" (Vol. iii., p. 282.).</p>

<p>I should conclude it to be a carelessly-made transcript of a
contemporary MS., the production, probably, of some warm royalist, who
may, or may not, have had some grounds for his assertions. At all
events, it gives a few curious details, and, in its general outline,
agrees singularly with the incidents on which Mrs. Behn's play, <i>The
Round Heads; or The Good Old Cause</i>, is founded: sufficiently so to give
it at least an air of authenticity, so far as the popular belief of the
day was concerned.</p>

<p class="right">  S. H. H.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "After Cromwell had been declared General of the Commonwealth's
   Forces, he seized the possessions of the Royalists, who had
   escaped his implacable resentment; and the New Hall fell to the
   share of the Usurper, who, flushed with the victory of Worcester,
   disposed at pleasure of the forsaken seates of the noble
   Fugitives, who still supported Charles II.'s Drooping Standards;
   and adding insulte to oppression, commanded the domesticks of the
   Duke of Buckingham to follow their master's desperate fortune,
   and to carry him five shillings, which he might want in his
   exile, for the purchase of a Lordship, whose yearly value
   exceeded then 1300<i>l.</i> Cromwell kept possession of New Hall till
   he assumed the title of Protector, and was instaled at White
   Hall, in the Pallace of the English Kings: Then he chose Hampton
   Court for his Summer Residence. He led at New Hall an obscure
   life, without pomp, without luxury, having but two servants in
   his retinue. Though his manners were natuaraly austere, he had
   some private amoures, which he indulged with great Caution and
   Secrecy. His favourites were General Lambert's wife and
   Major-General Vernon's sister: the first was a well-bred, genteel
   woman, fatheless to her husband from natural aversion, and
   attached to Cromwell from a conformity of inclination in a
   mysterious enjoyment and stolen embraces, with mask of religious
   deportment and severe virtue: the other was a person made to
   inspire lust and desire, but selfish, revengfull, and indiscreet.
   These too rivals heartily detested each other: Mrs. Lambert
   reproached Cromwell for his affection to a worthless, giddy, and
   wanton woman; and Mrs. Vernon laughed at him for being the dupe
   of the affected fondness and hipocry of an artful Mistress. They
   once met at the house of Colonel Hammond, a Creature of
   Cromwell's, and reviled each other with the most virulent
   sarcasms. Mrs. Lambert, fired with rage and resentment, went
   immediately to New Hall, where Oliver was at that juncture, and
   insisted upon her Rival's dismission for her unprovoked outrage.
   Cromwell, who was then past the meridian of voluptuous
   sensations, sacrificed the person he was no longer fit to enjoy,
   to a woman who had gained his esteem and confidence, and
   delegated to Mrs. Lambert all the domestic concerns of his house
   in Essex. Cromwell's wife, called afterwards the Protectress, was
   a sober helpmate, who, dressed in humble stuff, like a Quaker,
   neither interfered in his amours or politics. She never went to
   New Hall but once, and that was on the 25th of April, 1652, when
   he invited all his family to a grand entertainment on account of
   his Birthday. The other Guests were, his mother, who survived his
   elevation to the Protectorship: she was a virtuous woman of the
   name of Stewart, related to the Royall Family; Desborough, his
   brother-in law; and Fleetwood, who had married his daughter; his
   Eldest Son, Richard, a man of an inoffensive and unambitious
   Character, who had been married some years, and lived in the
   country on a small estate which he possessed in right of his
   wife, where he spent his time in acts of benevolence: at the
   trial of Charles I. he fell on his knees and conjured his Father
   in the most pathetic manner to spare the life of his Sovereign;
   his brother Henry, afterwards Govonor of Ireland, where he was
   universally beloved for his mild administration; Mrs. Claypole,
   the darling of her father; and his three other daughters: Mrs.
   Rich, married to the Grandson and heir of the Earl of Warwick;
   Lady Falconbridge; and the Youngest, who lived in celibacy. They
   spent a week at New Hall, in innocent mirth and jollity; Oliver
   himself joining in convivial pleasure with his children,
   disengaged the whole time from state affairs and Political
   Speculations.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"His constant visitors at New Hall were some Regicides, and the
   meanest, lowest, and most ignorant among the Citizens on whome he
   had decreed that the Sovereign power should be vested. To excell
   in Fanaticism seemed a necessary qualification in this new
   parliment; and Oliver foresaw that they would soon throw up the
   reins of Government, which they were unqualified to guide, and
   raise himself to an unlimited power far beyond that of former
   Kings.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "It seems Mrs. Lambert continued to reside at New Hall during
   Cromwell's Protectorship, and that Col. Wite, his trusty friend,
   was often sent with kind messages and preasants from Oliver, who
   travelled himself in the night, with hurry and precipitation, to
   enjoy with her some moments of domestic comfort and tranquility."</p>




<h3><span>SPURIOUS EDITION OF BAILY'S ANNUITIES.</span></h3>

<p>In the course of last year a curious and impudent bibliographical fraud
was perpetrated by some parties unknown. I am not aware that it has been
publicly exposed as yet.</p>

<p>The celebrated work on annuities, by the late Francis Baily, was
published in 1810 by Richardson, and printed by Richard Taylor. It was
at first in one volume: but on the publication of an appendix in 1813,
two titles were printed with this last date, and the stock then
remaining was sold in two volumes. As the book became scarce, it
gradually rose in price, until, when by a rare chance a copy came to the
hammer, it seldom fetched less than five guineas. This price was
lowered, as well by the general decline in the
<span class="pagenum">[20]</span><a id="the20"></a>
price of old
books, as by the sale of Mr. Baily's own library in 1844, which threw a
few copies into the market; but the work was still saleable at more than
the original price. In the course of last year, copies, as it was
pretended, of the original edition were offered at the assurance
offices, and to individuals known to be interested in the subject, at
twenty-five shillings. Some were taken in, others saw the trick at once.
There has been, in fact, a reprint without any statement of the
circumstance, and without a printer's name; but with a strong, and, on
the whole, successful attempt at imitation of the peculiar typography of
the work. If the execution had been as good as the imitation, the
success would have been greater. But this is wretchedly bad, and will
amuse those who know how very particular Mr. Baily always was in his
superintendence of the press, and how plainly his genuine works bear the
marks of it.</p>

<p>The spurious edition may be known at once by the title-page, in which
the words "an appendix" are printed in open letter, which is not the
case in the original. Also by "Leienitz," instead of "Leibnitz" in page
xi. of the preface. Also by the Greek letter </p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/image1.jpg" width="44" height="41" alt="[Greek letter delta rotated 180 degrees.]" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">throughout, which is, in the spurious edition, never anything
but an inverted <ins title="Greek: delta">&#948;</ins>, which looks as if it were trying to kick
backwards.</p>

<p>In all probability, the agents in this shabby trick are beneath reproof;
but it is desirable that the reputation of the author whom they have
chosen for its object should not suffer from the effects of their
misprint. And as the work they have appropriated is only used by a small
public, and a reading one, the mode of exposure which I here adopt will
probably be sufficient.</p>

<p>The spurious edition is now on the stalls at a few shillings; and, as a
curiosity, will be worth its price.</p>

<h4><span><i>Les Anguilles de Melun.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;"Les anguilles de Melun crient avant qu'on
les écorche" is a well-known proverb in that town; and as some of your
readers may be curious to learn the circumstances in which it
originated, I send them to you for "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>."</p>

<p>According to the traditions of the Church, Saint Bartholomew was flayed
alive, and his skin rolled up and tied to his back. When the religious
dramas, called <i>Mysteries</i>, came into vogue, this martyrdom was
represented on the stage at Melun, and the character of the saint was
personated by one <i>Languille</i>. In the course of the performance, the
executioner, armed with a knife, made his appearance; and as he
proceeded to counterfeit the operation of flaying, Languille became
terrified and uttered the most piteous cries, to the great amusement of
the spectators. The audience thereupon exclaimed, "Languille crie avant
qu'on l'écorche;" and hence the "jeu de mots," and the proverb.</p>

<p>The following explanation is given of this enigmatical statement.
Christopher Burraway was the fruit of an incestuous connexion between a
father and daughter, and was early placed in the Foundling Hospital,
from whence, when he came of age, he was apprenticed to a farmer. Coming
in after years by chance to Martham, he was hired unwittingly by his own
mother as farm steward, her father (or rather the father of both) being
dead. His conduct proving satisfactory to his mistress she married him
who thus became, successively, mother, sister, mistress, and wife, to
this modern &OElig;dipus. The episode remains to be told. Being discovered
by his wife to be her son, by a peculiar mark on his shoulder, she was
so horror-stricken that she soon after died, he surviving her scarcely
four months. Of the other slab enough remains to show that it covered
her remains; but the registers from 1729 to 1740 are unfortunately
missing so that I cannot trace the family further.</p>

<h4><span><i>First Panorama</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 526.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I remember when a boy going to
see that panorama. I was struck with "the baker knocking at the door, in
Albion Place, and wondered the man did not <i>move!</i>" But this could not
have been the first (though it might have been the first publicly
exhibited), if what is told of Sir Joshua Reynolds be true, that, having
held that the painting of a panorama was a "thing impossible," on the
sight of it he exclaimed&mdash;"This is the triumph of perspective!" I have

<h4><span><i>Principle of Notation by Coalwhippers, &amp;c.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I shall feel much obliged
to any of your readers who can inform me whether the principle adopted
by the coalwhippers on the river Thames, and by the seafaring class in
general, is adopted by any other class in these islands, or particularly
in the North of Europe.</p>

<p>This principle may be thus explained, viz.:</p>

<p>1. A set of four perpendicular, equal, and equidistant straight lines
are cut by a diagonal line, which runs from <i>right</i> to <i>left</i>; that is
to say, from the higher end of the fourth line to the lower extremity of
the first line. This diagonal then represents number 5, and completes
the scale or tally of 5.</p>

<p>2. A similar set of four lines are cut by another diagonal, which passes
from <i>left</i> to <i>right</i>, or from the higher extremity of number one, to
the lower extremity of number four. The diagonal thus completes the
second score or tally for number 5.</p>

<p>The two fives are marked or scored separately, and the diagonals thus
form a series of alternations, which, when repeated, form a scale of
ten, the tally of the <i>coalwhippers</i>.</p>

<p>The "navvies" of the railroads carry this principle somewhat further.
They form a cross with two diagonals on the perpendiculars, and count
for ten; then, by repeating the process, they have a division into tens,
and count by two tens, or a score.</p>

<p>In the extracts from Aske's Collections relating to the descendants of

p. 248., it is stated:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Mathew of Bitton was married unto Constantyne Kingston, daughter
   to the Lord Thomas of Kingston; and of the said Mathew and
   Constantyne came John of Bitton, which died in Portingale."</p>

<p>In a pedigree (<i>Harl. MSS.</i> 1982. p. 102.) which shows the descendants
of Furneaux, the match between "Sir Math. Bitton" and C. Kingston is
laid down, and her arms are marked sab. a lion ramp. or.</p>

<p>With regard to Mathew de Bitton, he was son and heir of John de Bitton
and Havisia Furneaux. The residence of the family was at Hanham, in the
parish of Bitton, Gloucestershire, at a place afterwards called "Barre's
Court," from Sir John Barre, who married Joan, the great-granddaughter
of the said Mathew. The house abutted on the Chace of Kingswood.</p>

<p>In the 48th of Edward III. a writ was issued, to inquire who were the
destroyers of the deer and game in his Majesty's Chace, when it was
found that Mathew de Bitton was "Communis malefactor de venasione Dom.
Regis in Chacia predicta." It was proved that he had killed thirty-seven
deer! After much difficulty, he was brought
<span class="pagenum">[23]</span><a id="brought23"></a>
 before the
justiciaries, when he acknowledged all his transgressions, and placed
himself at the mercy of the king. He was committed "prisonæ Dom. Regis,

<h4><span><i>Possession nine Points of the Law.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;What is the origin of the

wish for is, not as to possession conferring a strong title to property,
which is self-evident, but as to the <i>number</i> of <i>points</i> involved in
the proposition, which I take to mean nine points out of ten. Has the
phrase any reference to the ten commandments or <i>points of law</i>
promulgated by Moses? I should add that <i>three</i> things are said to be
necessary to confer a perfect title to land, namely, possession, right
of possession, and right of property.</p>

with any information respecting Bourne, whose history of
Newcastle-on-Tyne was published in 1736, after the author's decease? I
know, I believe, all that is to be gathered from local sources, but
should be greatly obliged by any references to printed or MS. works
which contain allusions to him or his writings. One of his college
friends was the <i>Reverend</i> Granville Wheler, Esq., of Otterden, Kent,
who, though in holy orders, chose to be so described, being the eldest
son of a knight, the amiable Sir George Wheler, Prebendary of Durham,
and Rector of Houghton-le-Spring.</p>

will any of your readers inform me who this person was? It is not

celebrated Presbyterian preacher during the Covenanting reign of terror
in Scotland, after the Glasgow General Assembly in 1638? If, as I
suppose, there is no truth in this, what was the parentage and early
history of Mr. Robert Douglas? Wodrow notices this report, and says that
he was born in England. See Wodrow's <i>Analecta</i>, 4to., 1842, vol. ii. p.

<h4><span><i>Peace Illumination, 1802.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Miss Martineau, in her <i>Introduction to the
History of the Peace</i>, p. 56., repeats the story told in a foot-note on
p. 181. of the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1802, of M. Otto, the French
ambassador, being compelled to substitute the word "amity" for the word
"concord" suspended in coloured lamps, in consequence of the irritated
mob's determination to assault his house, unless the offensive word
"concord" were removed, the said mob reading it as though it were
spelled "conquered," and inferring thence that M. Otto intended to
insinuate that John Bull was <i>conquered</i> by France. The story, moreover,
goes on to relate that the mob also insisted that the blazing initials
G.R. should be surmounted by an illuminated crown. This anecdote,
notwithstanding its embalmment in the <i>Annual Register</i>, has always
borne in my eyes an apocryphal air. It assumes that the mob was ignorant
and intellectual at the same moment; that whilst it was in a riotous
mood it was yet in a temper to be reasoned with, and able to comprehend
the reasons addressed to it. But one cannot help fancying that the
mental calibre which understood "concord" to mean "conquered," would
just as readily believe that "amity" meant "enmity," to say nought of
its remarkable patience in waiting to see the changes dictated by itself
carried out. This circumstance occurred, if at all, within the memory of
many subscribers to "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." Is there one amongst them whose

<h3><span>PRINCESSES OF WALES.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 477.)</span></h3>

<p>The statement of Hume, that Elizabeth and Mary were created Princesses
of Wales, rests, I am disposed to think, on most insufficient authority;
and I am surprised that so illustrious an author should have made an
assertion on such slender grounds, which carries on the face of it a
manifest absurdity, and which was afterwards retracted by the very
author from whom he borrowed it.</p>

<p>Hume's authority is evidently Burnet's <i>History of the Reformation</i>;
(indeed, in some editions your correspondent G. would have seen Burnet
referred to) in which are the following passages (vol. i. p. 71., Oxford
edition, 1829):</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The King, being out of hopes of more children, declared his
   daughter (Mary) Princess of Wales, and sent her to Ludlow to hold
   her court there, and projected divers matches for her."</p>

<p>Again, p. 271.:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Elizabeth was soon after declared Princess of Wales; though
   lawyers thought that against law, for she was only heir
   presumptive, but not apparent, to the crown, since a son coming
   after he must be preferred. Yet the king would justify what he
   had done in his marriage with all possible respect; and having
   before declared the Lady Mary Princess of Wales, he did now the
   same in favour of the Lady Elizabeth."</p>

<p>Hume's statement is taken almost verbatim from this last passage of
Burnet, who, however, it will be observed, does not say "created," but
"declared" Princess of Wales; the distinction between which is obvious.
He was evidently not aware that Burnet afterwards corrected this
statement in an Appendix, entitled, "Some Mistakes in the first Portion
of this History communicated to me by Mr. William Fulman, Rector of
Hampton Meysey, in Gloucestershire." In this is the following
<span class="pagenum">[25]</span><a id="following25"></a>
note, in correction of the passages I have quoted (Burn. <i>Hist. Ref.</i>,
vol. iv. p. 578.):</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Here and in several other places it is supposed that the next
   heir apparent of the crown was Prince of Wales. The heir apparent
   of the crown is indeed prince, but not, strictly speaking, of
   Wales, unless he has it given him by creation; and it is said
   that there is nothing on record to prove that any of Henry's
   children were ever created Prince of Wales. There are indeed some
   hints of the Lady Mary's being styled Princess of Wales; for when
   a family was appointed for her, 1525, Veysey, bishop of Exeter,
   her tutor, was made president of Wales. She also is said to have
   kept her house at Ludlow; and Leland says, that Tekenhill, a
   house in those parts, built for Prince Arthur, was prepared for
   her. And Thomas Linacre dedicates his <i>Rudiments of Grammar</i> to
   her, by the title of Princess of Cornwall and Wales."</p>

<p>This is one of the many instances of the inaccuracy, carelessness, and
(where his religious or political prejudices were not concerned)
credulity of Burnet. Whatever he found written in any previous
historian, unless it militated against his preconceived opinions, he
received as true, without considering whether the writer was entitled to
credit, and had good means of gaining information. Now, neither Hall,
Holinshed, Polydore Virgil, nor (I think) Cardinal Pole, contemporary
writers, say anything about Mary or Elizabeth being Princesses of Wales.
The only writer I am acquainted with who does say any such thing,
previous to Burnet, and whose authority I am therefore compelled to
suppose the latter relied on, when he made the statement which he
afterwards contradicted, is Pollini, an obscure Italian Dominican, who
wrote a work entitled <i>L'Historia Ecclesiastica della Rivoluzion
d'Inghilterra; Racolta da Gravissimi Scrittori non meno di quella
Nazione, che dell' altri, da F. Girolamo Pollini dell' ordine de
Predicatori, della Provincio de Toscana</i>: Roma, Facciotti, 1594. In book
i. chapter ii. page 7. of this author is the following statement, which
I translate, speaking of the Princess Mary:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "As the rightful heir of the throne she was declared by Henry,
   her father, Princess of Wales, which is the ordinary title borne
   by the first-born of the king; since the administration and
   government of this province is allowed to no other, except to
   that son or daughter of the king, to whom, by hereditary right,
   on the death of the king the government of the realm falls.... In
   the same way that the first-born of the French king is called the
   Dauphin, so the first-born of the English king is called Prince
   of Britain, or of Wales, which is a province of that large
   island, lying to the west, and containing four bishoprics. Which
   Mary, with the dignity and title of Princess, assisted by a most
   illustrious senate, and accompanied by a splendid establishment,
   administered with much prudence," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Pollini's history is, as may be supposed, of very little historical
value; and one feels surprised that, on a point like the present, Burnet
should have allowed himself to be misled by him. But still more
remarkable, in my opinion, is the use Miss Strickland makes of this
author. After several times giving him as her authority at the foot of
the page, by the name of <i>Pollino</i>, but without giving the least
information as to the name of his work, or who he was, she has the
following note relating to the passage I have quoted (<i>Lives of the
Queens of England</i>, vol. v. p. 156.):</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "The Italian then carefully explains that the Princes of Wales
   were in the same position, in regard to the English crown, as the
   Dauphins were to that of France. Pollino must have had good
   documentary evidence, since he describes Mary's council and
   court, which he calls a senate, exactly as if the Privy Council
   books had been open to him. <i>He says four bishops were attached
   to this court.</i>"</p>

<p>It seems to one a singular mode of proving that Pollini must have had
good documentary evidence, by saying that he speaks exactly and
positively; and I would ask what <i>good</i> documentary evidence would a
Florentine friar be likely to have, who certainly never was in England,
and in all probability never far from his convent? But it is the
statement about the bishops that I wish more particularly to allude to,
as I can find <i>no statement to that effect in Pollini</i>, and can only
suppose that Miss Strickland misunderstood the passage (quoted above)
where he says the province of Wales contains four bishoprics.</p>

<p>I think I have now shown that Hume's statement rests on no sufficient
grounds as to the authority from whence he derived it. But there is yet
another reason against it, which is this: it would be necessary, before
Elizabeth was created Princess of Wales, that Mary should be deprived of
it; and this could only be done by a special act of parliament. But we
find no act of such a nature passed in the reign of Henry VIII. There
are other reasons also against it; but having, I think, said enough to
show the want of any foundation for the assertion, I shall not trouble
you any further.</p>

<h3><span>THE LATE MR. WILLIAM HONE.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 477.)</span></h3>

<p>In reply to the inquiry of E.V. relative to the conversion of the late
Mr. William Hone, I send a slight reminiscence of him, which may perhaps
be generally interesting to the readers of the <i>Every Day Book</i>. It was
soon after the period when Mr. Hone (at the time afflicted both in "body
and estate") began to acknowledge the truths of Christianity, that I
accidentally had an interview with him, though a perfect stranger. Our
conversation was brief, but it turned upon the adaptation of the
Christian religion to the
<span class="pagenum">[26]</span><a id="the26"></a>
wants of man, in all the varied
stations in which he may be placed on earth, independent of its
assurance of a better state hereafter. With child-like meekness, and
earnest sincerity, the once contemner and reviler of Christianity
testified to me that all his hope for the future was in the great
atonement made to reconcile fallen man to his Creator.</p>

<p>Before we parted, I was anxious to possess his autograph, and asked him
for it; as I had made some collection towards illustrating, his <i>Every
Day Book</i>, to which it would have been no inconsiderable addition. After
a moment of deep thought, he presented me with a slip of paper inscribed
as follows, in his small and usual very neat hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

          <p> "'He that increaseth knowledge</p>

<p>At the sale of Mr. Hone's books, I purchased a bundle of religious
pamphlets; among them was <i>Cecil's Friendly Visit to the House of
Mourning</i>. From the pencillings in it, it appears to have afforded him
much comfort in the various trials, mental and bodily, which it is well
known clouded his latter days.</p>

<h3><span>SHAKSPEARE'S "SMALL LATIN."&mdash;HIS USE OF "TRIPLE."<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 497.)</span></h3>

<p>In reference to the observations of A. E. B., I beg leave to say that,
in speaking of Shakspeare as a man who had <i>small Latin</i>, I intended no
irreverence to his genius. I am no worshipper of Shakspeare, or of any
man; but I am willing to do full justice, and to pay all due veneration,
to those powers which, with little aid from education, exalted their
possessor to the heights of dramatic excellence.</p>

<p>As to the extent of Shakspeare's knowledge of Latin, I think that it was
well estimated by Johnson, when he said that "Shakspeare had Latin
enough to grammaticize his English." Had he possessed much more than was
sufficient for this purpose, Ben Jonson would hardly have called his
knowledge of the language <i>small</i>; for about the signification of
<i>small</i> there can be no doubt, or about Ben's ability to determine
whether it was small or not. But this consideration has nothing to do
with the appreciation of Shakspeare's intellect: Shakspeare might know
little of Latin and less of Greek, and yet be comparable to Æschylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides; as Burns, who may be said to have known no
Latin, is comparable, in many passages, even to Horace. "The great
instrument of the man of genius," says Thomas Moore, "is his own
language," which some knowledge of another language may assist him to
wield, but to the wielding of which the knowledge of another language is
by no means necessary. The great dramatists of Greece were, in all
probability, entirely ignorant of any language but their own; but such
ignorance did not incapacitate them from using their own with effect,
nor is to be regarded as being, in any way, any detraction from their
merits. Shakspeare had but a limited acquaintance with Latin, but such
limited acquaintance caused no debilitation of his mental powers, nor is
to be mentioned at all to his disparagement. I desire, therefore, to be
acquitted, both by A. E. B. and by all your other readers, of
entertaining any disrespect for Shakspeare's high intellectual powers.</p>

<p>As to his usage of the word <i>triple</i>, that it is "fairly traced to
Shakspeare's own reading" might not unreasonably be disputed. We may,
however, concede, if A. E. B. wishes, that it was derived from his own
reading, <i>as no trace of its being borrowed is to be found</i>. But I am
not sure that if other writers had taken pains to establish this use of
the word in our tongue, its establishment would have been much of a
"convenient acquisition." Had any man who has three sisters, closely
conjoined in bonds of amity, the privilege of calling any one of them a
<i>triple sister</i>, I do not consider that he or his language would
<span class="pagenum">[27]</span><a id="would27"></a>
be much benefited. Ovid, I fear, employed <i>triplex</i> "improperly," as
Warburton says that Shakspeare employed <i>triple</i>, when he spoke of the
Fates spinning <i>triplici pollice</i>. I cannot find that any writer has
imitated him. To call the Fates <i>triplices deæ</i> (<i>Met.</i> viii. 481.), or
<i>triplices sorores</i> (<i>Met.</i> viii. 453.), was justifiable; but to term
any one of them <i>triplex dea</i>, or to speak of her as spinning <i>triplici
fuso</i> or <i>triplici pollice</i>, was apparently to go beyond what the Latin
language warranted. A. E. B. rightly observes that <i>triple</i> must be
explained as signifying "belonging to three conjoined;" but the use of
it in such a sense is not to be supported either by custom or reason,
whether in reference to the Latin language or to our own.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, in his observations on "captious," has a very unlucky
remark, which A. E. B. unluckily repeats&mdash;"We, no doubt, all know," says
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, "by intuition as it were, what Shakspeare meant." If we all
know Shakspeare's meaning by intuition, how is it that the "true
worshippers of Shakspeare" dispute about his meaning?</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Replies to Minor Queries.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>Family of Etty, the Artist</i> </span><span>(Vol. iii., p. 496.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;"Mr. Etty, Sen., the
architect," mentioned in the passage quoted by your correspondent from
Thoresby's <i>Diary</i>, was John Etty, who died Jan. 28th, 1709, at the age
of seventy-five. Drake calls him "an ingenious architect," and quotes
these lines from his epitaph in the church of All Saints, North Street,
in York (<i>Eboracum</i>, p. 277.):&mdash;</p>

   <div class="poem">
<p>  "His art was great, his industry no less,</p>
    <p>  What one projected, t'other brought to pass."</p>
</div>

<p>Although Thoresby and Drake dignify him with the title of architect, he
was in fact a carpenter, or what would now be styled "a builder." Mr.
Etty had several sons: Marmaduke, the painter mentioned by Thoresby, was
one of them. He was called in those days a painter-stainer. Two others,
James and William, were brought up to the business of a carpenter&mdash;as
their father and grandfather were before then. William had two sons: the
eldest of whom, John, was also a carpenter. The other was the Reverend
Lewis Etty, clerk; who, about a century ago, was incumbent of one of the
York churches. I suspect that no work is now extant which is known to be
the production of either the architect or the painter; and, but for the
incidental allusion to them in the <i>Diary</i> of the Leeds antiquary, the
memory of their very names had long since perished. The fact stated in
the <i>Diary</i>, of Grinlin Gibbons having wrought at York with Mr. Etty,
the architect, is not mentioned in any of the biographical notices of
that skilful artist, although its accuracy may be safely accepted upon
Thoresby's authority.</p>

<p>The late William Etty, R.A., never claimed descent from the old York
family. Most probably he did not know that such persons ever existed.
His father, John Etty, and his grandfather, Matthew Etty, were
established as millers at York during the latter part of the last
century. To the occupation of a miller, John Etty added that of a
ginger-bread baker; and in the house in Feasegate, York, where his
distinguished son was born, he carried on an extensive business in
supplying the smaller shops and itinerant dealers with gingerbread of
all descriptions, when it was a more popular luxury or "folk-cate" than
it is now. A characteristic anecdote is told of William Etty, which may
not inappropriately be introduced here. In his latter days, when in the
zenith of his fame, the large sum he was about to receive for one of his
pictures was the subject of conversation at a friend's table. "Ah!" said
the artist, with the quiet simplicity of manner for which he was
remarkable, "it will serve to gild the gingerbread!"</p>

<p>It is possible that a keen genealogist might succeed in connecting the
illustrious artist of our day with the Ettys of Thoresby's time, and
thus establish a case of hereditary genius. "Mr. Etty, the painter," had
a son called John, who attained man's estate about the year 1710. He
does not appear to have settled at York, and it is by no means out of
the range of probability, that he was the progenitor of Matthew Etty,
the miller; who was, I believe, a native of Hull, and who, by the way,
named one of his sons, John.</p>

<h4><span><i>Parish Register of Petworth</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 449. 485. 510.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;By the
parish register abstract accompanying the population returns of 1831, it
appears that in that year the earliest existing register of Petworth
commenced in 1559. We are indebted to the late Mr. Rickman for this
abstract of the dates of all the parish registers in the kingdom; and it
would be well if, at the next census, a similar return was called for,
that it may be seen what registers are then missing.</p>

<p>As to lost registers, I may state that I possess the bishop's
transcripts of sixty registers, signed by the minister and churchwardens
of parishes in the county of Kent; they comprise the baptisms,
marriages, and burials for the years 1640 and 1641. The registers of
sixteen of these parishes do not begin until after 1641, consequently
these transcripts are the only records now existing of the baptisms,
marriages, and burials in those sixteen parishes for 1640 and 1641.</p>

<h4><span><i>Death</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 450.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The ancients found in the successive
transformations of the butterfly a striking and beautiful parallel to
the more important career of human existence. Thus to their fancy the
caterpillar, or <i>larva</i>, represented man's earthly course; the <i>pupa</i>,
or chrysalis state, his death and utter inanition; while the perfect
state
<span class="pagenum">[28]</span><a id="state28"></a>
of the insect typified man's rise to life and glory, a
bright glorious being, without spot or trace of earthly stain. The
Greeks from this notion named the butterfly "Psyche." A careful
examination of the anatomy and physiology of the insect world will show
the strict and amazing beauty of this simile.</p>

<h4><span><i>Lord Mayor not a Privy Councillor</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 9.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your printer has
misprinted <i>clamour</i> instead of your own expression <i>demur</i>. Let me add
that there was neither <i>clamour</i> nor even <i>demur</i> on that occasion&mdash;all
went off quietly in the usual course. There is also an omission of two
words in a subsequent line, which, though easily supplied, I may as well
notice.</p>

<p>"The proclamation is that of the <i>peers alone</i>, but assisted by the
<i>others</i>," should rather be "the proclamation is that of the <i>peers
alone</i>, but assisted by the <i>ex-Privy Councillors and others</i>," as this
marks the distinction between the two classes of <i>assistants</i> more
strongly.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Here he uses the word <i>complexion</i> as something distinct from "tincture
of the skin." The colour of the hair and irides commonly indicates the
colour of the skin. If they are dark, the skin is ordinarily dark; and
if blue or light, the skin is ordinarily fair. I have seen flaxen hair
and surpassing whiteness of skin with eyes as black as death.</p>

<p>&mdash;As a means of furnishing your

to identify the place where that memorable council was convened, by
which the succession to the English crown was transferred from the
Danish to the Saxon line, I would refer him to Lambard's <i>Perambulation

<h4><span><i>Nao, a Ship</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 477. 509.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I perfectly agree with G<span class="smcap lowercase">OMER</span>
that the early Britons must have possessed vessels more capacious than
osier baskets or <i>cyry-glau</i> before they were able to transport warlike
assistance to their brethren the Armoricans of Gaul; but I can inform
GOMER and A. N. in addition, that a much older term for a ship was made
use of by the first inhabitants of Britain, namely <i>Naf</i>, from whence no
doubt the Latin <i>Navis</i> sprang; and from the same root the Welsh word
<i>Nawf</i>, a swim (now used), was derived. This term <i>Naf</i> is handed down
to us in one of the oldest British triads, but which has been always, in
my opinion, improperly interpreted. In speaking of the three master
works of the island of Britain, is the ship of Nefydd Naf Neifion (or
<i>Noah</i>); the translation is simply this&mdash;</p>

<h4><span><i>John Perrot</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 336.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I possess a neatly written MS., of
88 pp. small 8vo., entitled <i>A Primmer for Children, written by a
suffering Servant of God, John Perrot; corrected, ammended, and made
more easie: London, in the Yeare 1664</i>. The only notice of him after
this date is in p. 290. of Sewel's <i>History of the Quakers</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Perrot now walked in an erroneous path, grew worse from time to
   time; even to that degree that, being come into America, he fell
   into manifold sensualities and works of the flesh; for he not
   only wore gawdy apparel, but also a sword; and being got into
   some place in the government, he became a severe exacter of

<h4><span><i>Sneck up</i></span> <span>(Vol. i., p. 467.; Vol. ii., p. 14.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;<i>Sneck up</i> is a stage
direction for <i>hiccup</i>, which Sir Toby was likely to observe after his
"pickle herring." Davis is quite right in following Theobald. A word for
Theobald. Every commentator is indebted to him, and almost every one has
abused him, from Warburton and Pope to Coleridge, and without Theobald's
notes and most sagacious amendments, ordinary readers would be puzzled
to <i>read</i> Shakspeare. The booksellers, I am glad to see, had sense
enough to see Theobald's merit, and gave him a far larger sum for his
edition than has been paid to most of his successors.</p>

<h4><span><i>Meaning of Senage</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 6.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Have the kindness to inform
W.H., that in my extracts from the Parish Account Book of St. Peter's
Mancroft in this city, under the years 1582 and 1588, are entered as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   "1582. P<span class="topnum">d</span> to the Bisshopp for Senage Money ... xxj<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>      1588. P<span class="topnum">d</span> for Senage and Proxage to the Bisshopp, ix<i>d</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>In Cowel's <i>Law Dictionary</i>, by Thomas Manley, folio, 1701, under the
term "Senege," he says: <span class="pagenum">[29]</span><a id="says29"></a></p>

<p class="blockquot">   "There goes out yearly in Proxage and Senage 33<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Perhaps
   senege may be money paid for Synodals, as Proxyes or
   Procurations." "Proxyes are yearly payments made by parish
   priests to their bishop, or archdeacon, in <i>lieu of victuals for
   the visitor and his attendants</i>" (which it was formerly the
   custom to provide).</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Senage. The Senes be only courts to gather Senage and Proxye.
   The bishop should hold a Synod or Sene twice a year."&mdash;Becon's
   <i>Reliques of Rome</i>, p. 213.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "The priests should come to the Sene as they were wont to do."</p>

<p>The senes, courts, or ecclesiastical councils, were held for the purpose
of correcting any neglect or omissions of the Church Reeves (as they
were called), and fining them for such omissions, as well as receiving
the usual and accustomed payments; and sometimes they were fined for
having <i>secreted some Catholic reliques</i>, which were discovered by the
visitors (of course after the Reformation), as I have found entries of
fines having been paid; and more frequently are entries of "Payd for the
withdraft" of the charge for some neglect in not providing articles
necessary for the performance of divine worship.</p>

<p>In Sir Thomas More's <i>Works</i>, folio, 1557, pp. 909., 991., "Senes or
Indightments" (perhaps Citements or Citations) are mentioned.</p>

<p>No doubt (I think) the term <i>senege</i> is derived from these courts being
termed "Senes" and "Seens."</p>

<h4><span><i>Early Visitations</i></span><span> (Vol. iv., p. 8.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your remark that Mr. Noble's
statements "are extremely loose" is, generally speaking, very just;
although in the particular instance referred to there is some foundation
for his statement, as in the 12th Henry VI. commissions were issued into
the several counties, not merely to collect the names of the gentry, but
to administer an oath to the gentry and others for conservation of the
peace and observance of the laws. The returns containing the names of
the parties sworn in all the counties (except twelve) are printed by
Fuller in his <i>Worthies</i> from records in the Tower, which are probably
yet extant. See <i>Rotuli Parliamentorum</i>, iv. 455.; v. 434.; Fuller's
<i>Worthies of England</i>, chap. xiv.; Grimaldi's <i>Origines Genealogicæ</i>,
68, 69. I do not understand that all the parties who were sworn were
accounted gentlemen, although Dr. Fuller's and Mr. Grimaldi's
impressions on this point appear to have been similar to Mr. Noble's.</p>

<h4><span><i>Rifles</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 517.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I am neither Mr. Gordon Cumming, nor an
officer of the Rifle Brigade; nevertheless, I have seen much of rifles
and rifle-firing; and I think I can assure your correspondent A. C. that
"<i>We</i> make the best rifles" is rather an assumption. That the Americans
make most excellent ones, there can be no doubt; but I question whether
they ever turned out a rifle which, either for finish or performance,
would bear comparison with those made by Purdey, Lancaster, and others.
As an example of what an English rifle will do, I subjoin the
performance<a id="performance4"></a> &mdash;&mdash;<a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of one made by Beattie of Regent Street on Minie's
principle for an officer in the artillery now going out to the Cape. At
<i>one thousand</i> measured yards, sixteen balls out of thirty were put into
the target; and at four hundred yards, balls were driven through four
regulation targets, each of two inch oak, placed six inches apart from
one another; and into the earthen mound behind them ten or twelve
inches. If the Americans can beat that, either for precision or force,
they may claim to make the best rifles.</p>

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p><i>A Glossary of Terms used for Articles of British Dress and Armour, by
the Rev. John Williams (ab Ithel)</i>, classifies alphabetically the
several names which our British forefathers applied to the different
portions of their garments and military weapons, and supplies the reader
with their English synonymes; and, in the majority of cases, cites
corroborative passages from documents in which the original terms occur.
Its value to the antiquaries of the Principality is sufficiently
obvious; and as Celtic elements may still be traced in our language, it
will clearly be found of equal utility to their English brethren.</p>

<p><i>The Golden and Silver Ages. Two Plays by Thomas Heywood, with an
Introduction and Notes by J. Payne Collier, Esq.</i> (which form the last
work issued by the Shakspeare Society), will be read with great interest
by the members; and, as completing the second volume of the collected
edition of the works of <i>Thomas Heywood</i>, will give great satisfaction
to those who urged upon the Shakspeare Society the propriety of printing
an edition of the works of this able and prolific dramatist.</p>

<p>In his <i>Manual of the Anatomy and Physiology of the Human Mind, by James
Carlile, D.D.</i>, the author has undertaken to write a popular treatise on
an abstruse subject; and though he exhibits pains and method, yet we can
hardly think that he has succeeded in his difficult task. One mistake he
has evidently made. He seeks his illustrations too much from recent
events, the Gorham controversy, the presidency of Louis Napoleon, and
the like; references which are more calculated to degrade a great
subject than to popularise it.</p>

<p>In <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> for the present month our readers will
find a very able article, to which we beg to direct their attention, on
the present state of
<span class="pagenum">[30]</span><a id="of30"></a>
English Historical Literature, the
accessibility of our Historical Materials and the Record Offices. The
article has apparently been called forth by a Memorial, addressed to the
Master of the Rolls, requesting "that persons who are merely engaged in
historical inquiry, antiquarian research, and other literary pursuits
connected therewith, should have permission granted to them to have
access to the Public Records, with the Indexes and Calendars, without
payment of any Fee." This important document is signed by all the
principal historical and antiquarian writers of the day: we should
think, therefore, that there can be little fear of their prayer being
refused. The writer of the article in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> has
omitted two curious facts, which deserve mention,&mdash;one that Pinkerton
was stopped in the progress of his History of Scotland by the fees for
searches in the Scotch Record Offices; the other, that those fees in
those very offices have recently been remitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas Allport has issued Proposals for the publication by
subscription of a volume entitled <i>Kits Coty House, a Monograph</i>, which,
as it is to treat not only of Kits Coty House, but of its Flora and
Fauna, the Druidical Circles of Addington and Colebrook, the Antiquarian
Relics and Traditions of the neighbourhood, Boxley and its Rood of
Grace, Chaucer and the Pilgrim's Road, and other vestiges of bygone
times, clearly has within its subject the materials for an amusing and
interesting volume.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
